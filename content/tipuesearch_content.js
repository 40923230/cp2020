We will begin with fiber-optic cable and then discuss twisted pair cable and coaxial cable. For each of these cable types, we will discuss appearance, characteristics, and types of connectors, as well as speed and limitations. \n 總覽 \n 在本模塊中，我們將討論各種類型的網絡媒體。 我們將從光纖電纜開始，然後討論雙絞線電纜和同軸電纜。 對於每種電纜類型，我們將討論連接器的外觀，特性和類型，以及速度和限制。 \n Fiber-Optic Cable \n \n \n \n \n Fiber-optic cables are constructed by using a glass core at the center of the cable that is surrounded by cladding. In order to send data from one end of the cable to the other, light from a light-emitting diode (LED) or laser is used to transmit the signal down the glass fiber at the center of the cable. Because the data is being transmitted using light, it is immune to the effects of electromagnetic interference (EMI) that impact traditional copper-based cables, such as twisted pair and coaxial cables. Fiber-optic cables possess the ability to send the data a very far distance (many miles) without the use of a repeater. They also can carry a significant amount of data due to their large bandwidth and the information traveling at light speed. Their bandwidth can be measured in gigabits or even terabits per second. There are two types of fiber cables: multimode and single-mode fiber. \n 光纖電纜 \n 光纖電纜是通過在電纜的中心使用玻璃芯構成的，該玻璃芯被包層圍繞。 為了將數據從電纜的一端發送到另一端，可使用來自發光二極管（LED）或激光的光沿電纜中心的玻璃纖維向下傳輸信號。 由於數據是通過光傳輸的，因此不受電磁干擾（EMI）的影響，電磁干擾會影響傳統的銅基電纜，如雙絞線和同軸電纜。 光纖具有無需使用中繼器就可以很遠的距離（許多英里）發送數據的能力。 由於它們的大帶寬和以光速傳播的信息，它們還可以攜帶大量數據。 它們的帶寬可以每秒千兆比特或什至兆兆比特來度量。 \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \n Fiber-optic cable.

A micron is a very small unit of measurement—it is actually even smaller than the width of a human hair. MMF’s larger core enables multiple modes of travel for the light from one end of the cable to the other. This allows a single fiber to carry multiple signals across it, with each signal being transmitted at a slightly different reflective angle. When the light reaches the destination, the signals are then converted back into 1s and 0s and passed to the computer by the network interface card. Multimode fiber is commonly used in shorter distance fiber connections, such as from a router to a switch, a switch to a switch, or a server to a switch. \n Single-mode fiber cables (SMF) contain a much smaller core than the multimode variety. The core size for SMF is 10 microns. SMF’s smaller core only allows for a single mode of travel for the light from one end of the cable to the other. This straight-through connection allows for data to travel longer distances without a repeater than it can travel using MMF. When the light reaches the destination, the signals are then converted back into 1s and 0s and passed to the computer by the network interface card. Single mode fiber is commonly used in very long distance fiber connections, such as a backbone connection from one local area network to another. \n 多模光纜（MMF）的芯線比單模光纜大。多模光纖的纖芯尺寸為62.5微米。微米是非常小的度量單位，實際上甚至比人類頭髮的寬度還小。MMF的較大芯線實現了從電纜一端到另一端的多種傳播模式。這樣一來，單根光纖就可以在其上傳輸多個信號，而每個信號都以稍微不同的反射角傳輸。當光線到達目的地時，信號然後被轉換回1和0，並通過網絡接口卡傳遞到計算機。多模光纖通常用於較短距離的光纖連接中，例如從路由器到交換機，從交換機到交換機或從服務器到交換機。 \n 單模光纜（SMF）的芯線比多模光纜小得多。 SMF的芯尺寸為10微米。 SMF的較小芯線僅允許光從電纜一端到另一端的單一傳播模式。 這種直通連接允許數據在沒有中繼器的情況下傳輸的距離比使用MMF傳輸的距離更長。 當光線到達目的地時，信號然後被轉換回1和0，並通過網絡接口卡傳遞到計算機。 單模光纖通常用於超長距離的光纖連接中，例如從一個局域網到另一個局域網的骨干連接。 \n Fiber-Optic Cable Connectors \n \n \n \n \n Fiber cables only come in the two types discussed above: single-mode and multimode. However, the ends of each of these cables come in four varieties. \n The subscriber connector (SC) is a fiber-optic cable connector that uses a push-pull mechanism to latch into the port, similar to common audio and video cables. If you want to enable bidirectional transmission for sending and receiving data, you need to have two fiber cables, so sometimes a dual SC connector is used. \n The straight tip (ST) connector is a fiber-optic cable connector that uses a bayonet plug and socket. It was the first de facto standard connector for most commercial wiring using fiber cables and it is very commonly found in fiber networks. \n The Lucent connector (LC) is a miniaturized version of the fiber-optic SC connector. It looks somewhat like the SC, but is half the size, with a 1.25 mm ferrule instead of 2.5 mm, making it very useful when connecting multiple devices in a small area, such as on a 24-port switch’s front panel. \n The mechanical transfer-registered jack (MT-RJ) connector is a fiber-optic cable connector that is very popular for small-form-factor devices due to its small size. This connector houses two fibers and mates with locating pins on the plug. These connectors are commonly found connecting a switch to a patch panel, because both devices have a limited area on their front panels. \n 光纖電纜連接器 \n 光纖電纜僅屬於上述兩種類型：單模和多模。但是，每條電纜的末端都有四種。 \n 用戶連接器（SC）是一種光纖電纜連接器，類似於普通的音頻和視頻電纜，它使用推挽機制鎖入端口。如果要啟用雙向傳輸以發送和接收數據，則需要兩條光纖電纜，因此有時會使用雙SC連接器。 \n 筆直（ST）連接器是使用卡口插頭和插座的光纖電纜連接器。它是大多數使用光纖電纜進行商業佈線的第一個事實上的標準連接器，在光纖網絡中非常常見。 \n 朗訊連接器（LC）是光纖SC連接器的微型版本。它看上去有點像SC，但尺寸只有一半，只有1.25毫米而不是2.5毫米的插芯，因此在小區域（例如24端口交換機的前面板）連接多個設備時非常有用。 \n 機械傳輸註冊插孔（MT-RJ）連接器是一種光纖電纜連接器，由於其尺寸小，在小型設備中非常受歡迎。該連接器容納兩根光纖，並與插頭上的定位銷配對。通常發現這些連接器將開關連接到配線架，因為兩個設備的前面板都有有限的區域。 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Which of the following is true of MMF fiber-optic cable? \n \n It is a straight-through connection. It enables multiple modes for light to travel through the cable. Its core size is 10 microns. All of the above. \n \n \n \n Brenda needs to connect a device to a patch panel.

Coaxial cable, also known as coax for short, is composed of two conductors. The inner conductor, which is known as the insulated conductor (center wire), is the copper wire over which data is passed. The outer conductor is the braided metal shield and aids in protecting the inner wire from physical injury and the effects of EMI. Much like the shielding we saw in shielded twisted pair, the outer shield helps keep electromagnetic interference out of the data’s path. Between the inner conductor and the outer shield, we find an insulated core that prevents any data transfer between the inner core and outer shield. The outside of the cable is made of a flexible plastic jacket, much like the twisted pair cabling. Coaxial cabling was included in the first Ethernet standard as 10Base5 (thicknet) and continued to be used throughout updates as 10Base2 (thinnet) as well as being most commonly used in bus and ring networks. UTP cabling however, is easier to work with in a star topology and is significantly less expensive. \n \n \n 同軸電纜是一種較老的媒體技術。同軸電纜，也簡稱為同軸電纜，由兩個導體組成。內部導體（稱為絕緣導體（中心線））是在其上傳遞數據的銅線。外導體是編織的金屬屏蔽層，有助於保護內線免受物理傷害和EMI的影響。就像我們在屏蔽雙絞線中看到的屏蔽一樣，外部屏蔽有助於將電磁干擾保持在數據路徑之外。在內部導體和外部屏蔽層之間，我們找到了一個絕緣芯，可防止在內芯和外部屏蔽層之間進行任何數據傳輸。電纜的外部由柔軟的塑料護套製成，非常類似於雙絞線電纜。同軸電纜已包含在第一個以太網標準中，稱為10Base5（Thicknet），並在整個更新中繼續用作10Base2（Thinnet），並且在總線和環形網絡中最常用。但是，UTP電纜更易於在星形拓撲中使用，並且價格便宜得多。 \n Coaxial Cable Types \n \n \n There are three dominant coaxial cable types. The RG-6 is commonly used by cable TV companies to connect individual homes to the TV network. These cables are thick and usually used for outside connections to withstand the effects of the weather. The RG-58 is a type of coaxial cable that was heavily used in early 10Base2 (thinnet) networks, such as bus and ring topologies. Finally, the RG-59 is the traditional coaxial cable used to carry composite video between two nearby devices, such as your TV and the cable box. If you are a cable Internet user, this is also used to carry the WAN connection from your wall jack to your cable modem. \n 同軸電纜類型 \n 共有三種主要的同軸電纜類型。 有線電視公司通常使用RG-6將單個房屋連接到電視網絡。 這些電纜很粗，通常用於外部連接以承受天氣的影響。 RG-58是一種同軸電纜，在諸如總線和環形拓撲之類的早期10Base2（瘦網）網絡中大量使用。 最後，RG-59是傳統的同軸電纜，用於在兩個附近的設備（例如電視和電纜盒）之間傳送複合視頻。 如果您是有線Internet用戶，這也可用於將WAN連接從牆壁插孔連接到電纜調製解調器。 \n Coaxial Cable Connectors \n \n \n \n \n While there were three types of cables, there are only two types of common connectors used with coaxial cable. The first is called BNC, from the name Bayonet Neill-Concelman. Sometimes people also call this the British Naval connector, because the BNC was heavily used by the British in their shipboard radio systems. This connector was commonly used in early Ethernet networks and it has a “push and twist” type of connector to secure the cable to the network device. \n The F-type connector is the modern type of coaxial cable connector. It is typically used for cable TV and cable modem connections. It is connected by screwing the connector onto a threaded jack to secure the connection. \n 同軸電纜連接器 \n 雖然有三種類型的電纜，但同軸電纜僅使用兩種類型的普通連接器。 第一個稱為BNC，名稱為刺刀Neill-Concelman。 有時人們也將其稱為英國海軍連接器，因為英國人在其艦載無線電系統中大量使用了BNC。 該連接器通常用於早期的以太網網絡，並且具有“推壓式”連接器，用於將電纜固定至網絡設備。 \n F型連接器是現代類型的同軸電纜連接器。 它通常用於有線電視和電纜調製解調器的連接。 通過將連接器擰到帶螺紋的插孔上進行連接以固定連接。 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n True or False: RG-6 coaxial cable is commonly used to connect your TV to your cable box. \n \n True False \n \n Correct.

However, twisted pair cabling does hold some advantages of its own. For one, it is much less expensive than fiber-optic cabling. Also, copper wiring is much easier to install, taking only a few hours to learn. Finally, twisted pair cabling can be created and terminated using inexpensive tools. For example, a complete copper wiring toolset can be bought online for less than $50, while a complete fiber-optic kit may cost $1000 or more. For these reasons, copper has remained the dominant media in most local area networks. \n 當我們比較光纖電纜和銅纜（雙絞線）的優缺點時，我們必須考慮到光纖具有更高的帶寬（以Gbps或Tbps為單位），它可以將其信號傳輸很多英里而無需作為中繼器，它不受EMI的影響，並且比傳統的雙絞線電纜具有更好的安全性。 但是，雙絞線電纜確實具有其自身的一些優點。 首先，它比光纖電纜便宜得多。 而且，銅線的安裝更容易，只需幾個小時即可學習。 最後，可以使用廉價的工具創建和終止雙絞線電纜。 例如，一套完整的銅線工具套件可以在線購買，價格不到50美元，而一套完整的光纖套件的價格可能在1000美元以上。 由於這些原因， \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n True or False: STP and UTP are two types of fiber-optic cable. \n \n True False \n \n \n \n Daven is concerned that EMI will adversely impact the network he is building.

For example, if you have to make a connection between two LANs in buildings that are located one mile apart, but your network uses Cat 5e, UTP cabling, how can you make that connection? When you look at your routers, you find they only accept RJ-45 connections, but you know that you cannot run a Cat 5e cable more than 100 meters. How can you solve this problem? With a media converter. \n Using a media converter, you can convert your RJ-45 connection into an ST, SC, or LC fiber connection, as shown in the image below. Then, you run the one-mile fiber cable to the other building, and use a media converter to convert from the ST, SC, or LC fiber connection back to the RJ-45 the other router requires. Because this is a simple, “dumb” device, it simply converts whatever is received on the first media type and repeats it back out the second media type. Common types of media converters are from Ethernet (copper) to fiber-optic (and back) or coaxial to fiber-optic (and back). \n 由於電纜和連接器的類型多種多樣，因此有時需要從一種類型的媒體轉換為另一種類型的媒體。例如，如果您必須在相距一英里的建築物中的兩個LAN之間建立連接，但是您的網絡使用Cat 5e，UTP電纜，那麼如何建立連接？當您查看路由器時，會發現它們僅接受RJ-45連接，但您知道不能將Cat 5e電纜的長度超過100米。您如何解決這個問題？帶媒體轉換器。 \n 使用媒體轉換器，您可以將RJ-45連接轉換為ST，SC或LC光纖連接，如下圖所示。 然後，將一英里的光纜連接到另一座建築物，並使用媒體轉換器將ST，SC或LC光纖連接轉換回另一台路由器所需的RJ-45。 因為這是一個簡單的“啞”設備，所以它僅轉換在第一媒體類型上接收到的所有內容，然後將其重複播放回第二媒體類型。 媒體轉換器的常見類型是從以太網（銅）到光纖（然後向後）或從同軸電纜到光纖（然後向後）。 \n \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Converters.html'}, {'title': '', 'text': 'Media converters.

Each communication is acknowledged upon receipt, providing a secure model to ensure successful communications. This type of transmission is great for all network data types, especially those that need delivery to be assured. \n TCP是一種面向連接的協議，可確保將數據段從一台設備可靠地傳輸到另一台設備。 在傳輸過程中，如果某個段丟失，則發起方設備將檢測到該段並將其重新發送或重新發送。 每次通信在收到後都會得到確認，從而提供一個安全的模型來確保成功進行通信。 這種傳輸方式適用於所有網絡數據類型，尤其是那些需要確保傳輸的網絡數據類型。 \n When a TCP communication is initiated, the originator and receiver perform a “three-way handshake” before starting the data transmission. In the first step, the originator sends a packet with a synchronization (SYN) flag set. Next, the receiver acknowledges receipt of this SYN flagged packet by sending back a synchronization-acknowledged (SYN-ACK) flagged packet. Finally, the originator sends an acknowledgement of the synchronization-acknowledged flagged packet, and then data transmission occurs. \n 啟動TCP通信時，發起方和接收方在開始數據傳輸之前執行“三向握手”。 第一步，發起方發送一個設置了同步（SYN）標誌的數據包。 接下來，接收器通過發回同步確認（SYN-ACK）標記的數據包來確認此SYN標記的數據包的接收。 最後，始發者發送對已同步確認的標記數據包的確認，然後發生數據傳輸。 \n \n EXAMPLE \n \n Think of this like two students who want to discuss an important project that is upcoming. The first student, Bob, says to Jane, “Jane, I want to talk to you.” Next, Jane says, “Bob, I acknowledge that you want to talk to me and I am ready to listen.” Finally, Bob tells her, “Jane, I understand you are ready to listen. Let’s talk.” At this point, the two students can talk, knowing they are both ready to listen to each other. \n \n \n 例 \n 就像兩個想討論即將開展的重要項目的學生一樣。 第一位學生鮑勃對簡說：“簡，我想和你說話。” \xa0 接下來，簡說：“鮑勃，我承認你想和我說話，我已經準備好傾聽。” \xa0 最後，鮑勃告訴她：“簡，我知道你已經準備好聽了。 讓我們談談。” \xa0 此時，兩個學生可以交談，知道他們倆都準備好了互相傾聽。 \n \n \n \n Diagram of TCP three-way handshake. Image used under CC-BY license from National STEM\xa0 Consortium. \n \n \n UDP, or user datagram protocol, was developed as a connectionless protocol in order to increase the speed of the network over TCP transmissions. Because of the three-way handshake in TCP, as well as all the delivery assurance and quality control, TCP has a good amount of network overhead that slows down its communications. Network engineers realized that sometimes you don’t need delivery assurance or quality control. So UDP was established. \n UDP（或用戶數據報協議）被開發為無連接協議，目的是通過TCP傳輸提高網絡速度。由於TCP中的三向握手以及所有的傳送保證和質量控制，TCP具有大量的網絡開銷，從而降低了其通信速度。網絡工程師意識到有時您不需要交付保證或質量控制。這樣就建立了UDP。 \n UDP is considered unreliable, because if a segment is dropped during transmission, the sending device doesn’t know and doesn’t care. There is no retransmission. Once data is sent, it is gone. This is good, though, for audio and video streaming. In these applications, the data transferred is enormously large, and if a single segment is dropped it doesn’t affect the overall quality of the audio or video sent. \n UDP被認為是不可靠的，因為如果在傳輸過程中丟棄了一個網段，則發送設備將不知道也不在乎。 沒有重傳。 數據一旦發送，就消失了。 但是，這對於音頻和視頻流來說是很好的。 在這些應用程序中，傳輸的數據非常大，如果丟棄單個段，則不會影響所發送的音頻或視頻的整體質量。 \n \n EXAMPLE \n \n I like to think of UDP as my college calculus teacher. He started at one side of the board at 8 a.m., and by 9 a.m. he was done at the other side of the board. He never asked if the students understood what he said or wrote, he just kept transmitting. This is a great example of UDP. \n \n \n 例 \n 我喜歡將UDP視為我的大學微積分老師。 他在上午8點從董事會的一側開始，到上午9點，他在董事會的另一側完成了工作。 他從不問學生是否理解他所說或寫的內容，他只是不斷地傳播。 這是UDP的一個很好的例子。 \n \n \n \n Diagram of UDP transmission.

TCP is reliable, but UDP is unreliable. TCP focuses on connection-oriented communications using the three-way handshake, while UDP is connectionless. TCP uses windowing, discussed in more detail later, to control the amount of data sent at a given time based on changing network speeds, but UDP simply transmits everything once with no windowing. TCP also supports segment sequencing; UDP just hopes it gets to the destination in the right order. Finally, TCP waits for acknowledgements, but UDP just hopes it got there. To simplify it, TCP is an assured and reliable communication method, UDP is just a best-effort model. \n TCPVs。UDP協議 \n TCP和UDP有很多區別。 TCP是可靠的，但UDP是不可靠的。 TCP專注於使用三向握手的面向連接的通信，而UDP是無連接的。 TCP使用開窗（稍後將詳細討論）來基於不斷變化的網絡速度來控制在給定時間發送的數據量，但是UDP僅傳輸所有信息一次而沒有開窗。 TCP還支持段排序； UDP只是希望它以正確的順序到達目的地。 最後，TCP等待確認，但是UDP只是希望它到達目的地。 為簡化起見，TCP是一種有保證且可靠的通信方法，UDP只是一種盡力而為的模型。 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n True or False: UDP is slower than TCP because UDP transmits everything at once with no windowing. \n \n True False \n \n \n \n True or False: TCP is more reliable than UDP. \n \n True False \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Golda needs to stream large amounts of video quickly.
