We will begin with fiber-optic cable and then discuss twisted pair cable and coaxial cable. For each of these cable types, we will discuss appearance, characteristics, and types of connectors, as well as speed and limitations. \n 總覽 \n 在本模塊中，我們將討論各種類型的網絡媒體。 我們將從光纖電纜開始，然後討論雙絞線電纜和同軸電纜。 對於每種電纜類型，我們將討論連接器的外觀，特性和類型，以及速度和限制。 \n Fiber-Optic Cable \n \n \n \n \n Fiber-optic cables are constructed by using a glass core at the center of the cable that is surrounded by cladding. In order to send data from one end of the cable to the other, light from a light-emitting diode (LED) or laser is used to transmit the signal down the glass fiber at the center of the cable. Because the data is being transmitted using light, it is immune to the effects of electromagnetic interference (EMI) that impact traditional copper-based cables, such as twisted pair and coaxial cables. Fiber-optic cables possess the ability to send the data a very far distance (many miles) without the use of a repeater. They also can carry a significant amount of data due to their large bandwidth and the information traveling at light speed. Their bandwidth can be measured in gigabits or even terabits per second. There are two types of fiber cables: multimode and single-mode fiber. \n 光纖電纜 \n 光纖電纜是通過在電纜的中心使用玻璃芯構成的，該玻璃芯被包層圍繞。 為了將數據從電纜的一端發送到另一端，可使用來自發光二極管（LED）或激光的光沿電纜中心的玻璃纖維向下傳輸信號。 由於數據是通過光傳輸的，因此不受電磁干擾（EMI）的影響，電磁干擾會影響傳統的銅基電纜，如雙絞線和同軸電纜。 光纖具有無需使用中繼器就可以很遠的距離（許多英里）發送數據的能力。 由於它們的大帶寬和以光速傳播的信息，它們還可以攜帶大量數據。 它們的帶寬可以每秒千兆比特或什至兆兆比特來度量。 \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \n Fiber-optic cable.

A micron is a very small unit of measurement—it is actually even smaller than the width of a human hair. MMF’s larger core enables multiple modes of travel for the light from one end of the cable to the other. This allows a single fiber to carry multiple signals across it, with each signal being transmitted at a slightly different reflective angle. When the light reaches the destination, the signals are then converted back into 1s and 0s and passed to the computer by the network interface card. Multimode fiber is commonly used in shorter distance fiber connections, such as from a router to a switch, a switch to a switch, or a server to a switch. \n Single-mode fiber cables (SMF) contain a much smaller core than the multimode variety. The core size for SMF is 10 microns. SMF’s smaller core only allows for a single mode of travel for the light from one end of the cable to the other. This straight-through connection allows for data to travel longer distances without a repeater than it can travel using MMF. When the light reaches the destination, the signals are then converted back into 1s and 0s and passed to the computer by the network interface card. Single mode fiber is commonly used in very long distance fiber connections, such as a backbone connection from one local area network to another. \n 多模光纜（MMF）的芯線比單模光纜大。多模光纖的纖芯尺寸為62.5微米。微米是非常小的度量單位，實際上甚至比人類頭髮的寬度還小。MMF的較大芯線實現了從電纜一端到另一端的多種傳播模式。這樣一來，單根光纖就可以在其上傳輸多個信號，而每個信號都以稍微不同的反射角傳輸。當光線到達目的地時，信號然後被轉換回1和0，並通過網絡接口卡傳遞到計算機。多模光纖通常用於較短距離的光纖連接中，例如從路由器到交換機，從交換機到交換機或從服務器到交換機。 \n 單模光纜（SMF）的芯線比多模光纜小得多。 SMF的芯尺寸為10微米。 SMF的較小芯線僅允許光從電纜一端到另一端的單一傳播模式。 這種直通連接允許數據在沒有中繼器的情況下傳輸的距離比使用MMF傳輸的距離更長。 當光線到達目的地時，信號然後被轉換回1和0，並通過網絡接口卡傳遞到計算機。 單模光纖通常用於超長距離的光纖連接中，例如從一個局域網到另一個局域網的骨干連接。 \n Fiber-Optic Cable Connectors \n \n \n \n \n Fiber cables only come in the two types discussed above: single-mode and multimode. However, the ends of each of these cables come in four varieties. \n The subscriber connector (SC) is a fiber-optic cable connector that uses a push-pull mechanism to latch into the port, similar to common audio and video cables. If you want to enable bidirectional transmission for sending and receiving data, you need to have two fiber cables, so sometimes a dual SC connector is used. \n The straight tip (ST) connector is a fiber-optic cable connector that uses a bayonet plug and socket. It was the first de facto standard connector for most commercial wiring using fiber cables and it is very commonly found in fiber networks. \n The Lucent connector (LC) is a miniaturized version of the fiber-optic SC connector. It looks somewhat like the SC, but is half the size, with a 1.25 mm ferrule instead of 2.5 mm, making it very useful when connecting multiple devices in a small area, such as on a 24-port switch’s front panel. \n The mechanical transfer-registered jack (MT-RJ) connector is a fiber-optic cable connector that is very popular for small-form-factor devices due to its small size. This connector houses two fibers and mates with locating pins on the plug. These connectors are commonly found connecting a switch to a patch panel, because both devices have a limited area on their front panels. \n 光纖電纜連接器 \n 光纖電纜僅屬於上述兩種類型：單模和多模。但是，每條電纜的末端都有四種。 \n 用戶連接器（SC）是一種光纖電纜連接器，類似於普通的音頻和視頻電纜，它使用推挽機制鎖入端口。如果要啟用雙向傳輸以發送和接收數據，則需要兩條光纖電纜，因此有時會使用雙SC連接器。 \n 筆直（ST）連接器是使用卡口插頭和插座的光纖電纜連接器。它是大多數使用光纖電纜進行商業佈線的第一個事實上的標準連接器，在光纖網絡中非常常見。 \n 朗訊連接器（LC）是光纖SC連接器的微型版本。它看上去有點像SC，但尺寸只有一半，只有1.25毫米而不是2.5毫米的插芯，因此在小區域（例如24端口交換機的前面板）連接多個設備時非常有用。 \n 機械傳輸註冊插孔（MT-RJ）連接器是一種光纖電纜連接器，由於其尺寸小，在小型設備中非常受歡迎。該連接器容納兩根光纖，並與插頭上的定位銷配對。通常發現這些連接器將開關連接到配線架，因為兩個設備的前面板都有有限的區域。 \n \n \n \n learn by doing \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Which of the following is true of MMF fiber-optic cable? \n \n It is a straight-through connection.

Coaxial cable, also known as coax for short, is composed of two conductors. The inner conductor, which is known as the insulated conductor (center wire), is the copper wire over which data is passed. The outer conductor is the braided metal shield and aids in protecting the inner wire from physical injury and the effects of EMI. Much like the shielding we saw in shielded twisted pair, the outer shield helps keep electromagnetic interference out of the data’s path. Between the inner conductor and the outer shield, we find an insulated core that prevents any data transfer between the inner core and outer shield. The outside of the cable is made of a flexible plastic jacket, much like the twisted pair cabling. Coaxial cabling was included in the first Ethernet standard as 10Base5 (thicknet) and continued to be used throughout updates as 10Base2 (thinnet) as well as being most commonly used in bus and ring networks. UTP cabling however, is easier to work with in a star topology and is significantly less expensive. \n \n \n 同軸電纜是一種較老的媒體技術。同軸電纜，也簡稱為同軸電纜，由兩個導體組成。內部導體（稱為絕緣導體（中心線））是在其上傳遞數據的銅線。外導體是編織的金屬屏蔽層，有助於保護內線免受物理傷害和EMI的影響。就像我們在屏蔽雙絞線中看到的屏蔽一樣，外部屏蔽有助於將電磁干擾保持在數據路徑之外。在內部導體和外部屏蔽層之間，我們找到了一個絕緣芯，可防止在內芯和外部屏蔽層之間進行任何數據傳輸。電纜的外部由柔軟的塑料護套製成，非常類似於雙絞線電纜。同軸電纜已包含在第一個以太網標準中，稱為10Base5（Thicknet），並在整個更新中繼續用作10Base2（Thinnet），並且在總線和環形網絡中最常用。但是，UTP電纜更易於在星形拓撲中使用，並且價格便宜得多。 \n Coaxial Cable Types \n \n \n There are three dominant coaxial cable types. The RG-6 is commonly used by cable TV companies to connect individual homes to the TV network. These cables are thick and usually used for outside connections to withstand the effects of the weather. The RG-58 is a type of coaxial cable that was heavily used in early 10Base2 (thinnet) networks, such as bus and ring topologies. Finally, the RG-59 is the traditional coaxial cable used to carry composite video between two nearby devices, such as your TV and the cable box. If you are a cable Internet user, this is also used to carry the WAN connection from your wall jack to your cable modem. \n 同軸電纜類型 \n 共有三種主要的同軸電纜類型。 有線電視公司通常使用RG-6將單個房屋連接到電視網絡。 這些電纜很粗，通常用於外部連接以承受天氣的影響。 RG-58是一種同軸電纜，在諸如總線和環形拓撲之類的早期10Base2（瘦網）網絡中大量使用。 最後，RG-59是傳統的同軸電纜，用於在兩個附近的設備（例如電視和電纜盒）之間傳送複合視頻。 如果您是有線Internet用戶，這也可用於將WAN連接從牆壁插孔連接到電纜調製解調器。 \n Coaxial Cable Connectors \n \n \n \n \n While there were three types of cables, there are only two types of common connectors used with coaxial cable. The first is called BNC, from the name Bayonet Neill-Concelman. Sometimes people also call this the British Naval connector, because the BNC was heavily used by the British in their shipboard radio systems. This connector was commonly used in early Ethernet networks and it has a “push and twist” type of connector to secure the cable to the network device. \n The F-type connector is the modern type of coaxial cable connector. It is typically used for cable TV and cable modem connections. It is connected by screwing the connector onto a threaded jack to secure the connection. \n 同軸電纜連接器 \n 雖然有三種類型的電纜，但同軸電纜僅使用兩種類型的普通連接器。 第一個稱為BNC，名稱為刺刀Neill-Concelman。 有時人們也將其稱為英國海軍連接器，因為英國人在其艦載無線電系統中大量使用了BNC。 該連接器通常用於早期的以太網網絡，並且具有“推壓式”連接器，用於將電纜固定至網絡設備。 \n F型連接器是現代類型的同軸電纜連接器。 它通常用於有線電視和電纜調製解調器的連接。 通過將連接器擰到帶螺紋的插孔上進行連接以固定連接。 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Coaxial Cable.html'}]};
